# SPOTIFY   : LIKE-OR-DISLIKE

## Project Description:
This is a binary classification problem where the task is to determine whether a user will like or not like a song on Spotify. The dataset contains various attributes of a song such as tempo, energy, danceability, etc., along with the target value where 0 represents not like and 1 represents like. Two model files are included in the project. One file demonstrates the use of trained models like logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest for solving the classification problem. The other file contains a neural network model for the same task.
